-Notes from Developer Landon: %%UPDATE LOG: 11/19/22
%The game finally works! I set a condition so that once the ticker reaches
%43 (you need to put in 42 numbers) The game stops and says you win. I made
%it so it the ticker value only increases when you put in the right number.
%When a number is incorrect, it displays a box that tells the user, and
%when they close it, it returns the question mark made back into an empty
%box, so it can be edited again. I also removed the drawScene commands from
%the long elseif statement, because I could just put it later to update
%when the code detects if the number is right first. I suspect that for the
%while condition we can get rid of the ticker entirely and just compare it
%to the finished board every iteration of the loop, but for now, it works.
%I also removed the close(h) command you had from the invalid box set of
%code, it wasn't working properly and crashed the code. I think we also
%should drawScene the next level after the user closes the box that
%announces that they won.
%ALSO: When you save the file, make sure to save it in one line, no spaces.
%I am going with the format SudokuProjectD/M/Y. If it has spaces in it or
%other unrecognized characters, then the code will not run.
